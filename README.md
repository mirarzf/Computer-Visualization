# Computer-Visualization
Dashboard for the visualization of the annotated data available in the [UnweaveNet activity stories repository](https://github.com/willprice/activity-stories).  
This dashboard was created for the final report of Advanced Course in Computer Visualization, course of KU, Spring 2022 and for my own understanding of the data in the previously cited repository. 

--- 

The dashboard was created using Python, Flask, pandas and matplotlib libraries. 
To make it work, download the pickled data from the [activity stories repository](https://github.com/willprice/activity-stories) and put it in a folder "data", that you create at the root of this repository. 
You can then run the app by running 
```
python app.py
```
Or use the following commands, as instructed in the [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/cli/): 
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app
$ flask run
```
